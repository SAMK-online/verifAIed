Introduction:
Users often struggle to verify whether the news and media content they are consuming is legitimate, leading to the risk of forming incorrect perspectives and opinions. While AI is a powerful tool in generating fake information, it can be equally effective in mitigating its impact. By leveraging real-time web and social media searches, an AI-driven agent can quickly validate any piece of content, ensuring its authenticity and reliability. This approach can help users make informed decisions based on verified, accurate information.

As AI gets more advanced, detection and bad actors attacking in new ways will constantly be a cat and mouse game so instead users will have to adapt to better verify sources and judge on their own and that is the intent of this desktop app, to automatically upon clicking a shortcut command, capture a screenshot of what you are looking at, and accordingly surface relevant content to help user decide and protect from misinformation.

User Journey:
User opens the desktop app, and leaves it running in the background.
Once the app is left open, the user can continue to consume the news/media as they wish to.
If they find something off, or feel suspicious about the legitimacy of content they are viewing they can use a keyboard shortcut that takes screenshots and takes the user to our app.
The app uses an AI agent to gain context from the screenshot.
The extracted info. From the screenshot is run through a web search. Using this search the app can tell users about sources and legitimacy of the data.
